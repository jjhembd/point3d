        <article><h1>point3d</h1>
<p>Cartesian 3D data type, with basic vector math methods</p>
<h2>How to use point3d in your project</h2>
<p>point3d is published as an NPM module. To install it in your project,
simply execute the following:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>npm install --save point3d
</code></pre>
<p>point3d exports a single class. The class constructor can be used to
construct Cartesian points at specified coordinates, as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>import { Point3d } from &quot;point3d&quot;;

const point = new Point3d({ x: 1.0, y: 1.0, z: 1.0 });
</code></pre>
<p>The constructed Point has attached methods to perform basic vector math,
such as equality checks, addition, subtraction, and scalar and vector products.
The methods are written in a pseudo-functional style, always returning the
result rather than modifying an existing object. This allows for a concise,
chainable syntax. For example, to compute the linear sum <code>a * x + b = c</code>,
you can simply chain as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-javascript"><code>const c = x.scale(a).plus(b);
</code></pre>
<p>See the documentation links at right for more details.</p>
<h2>About point3d development</h2>
<p>point3d was written in a single 3-hour sprint. Development began with a
30-minute strategizing session, during which the following key decisions were
made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Code would be written as an <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">ES6 class</a>. This means it is not supported in
Internet Explorer. But all other major browsers support classes, and classes
are a good fit for defining a data type</li>
<li>Methods would be written in a pseudo-functional style, returning a new instance
of the class where necessary. While potentially not as memory-efficient as
modify-in-place libraries like <a href="https://glmatrix.net/">glMatrix</a>, it allows
for more concise syntax</li>
<li>The constructor would input an object with x, y, and z properties, rather than
separate parameters for each coordinate. This decision is perhaps of debatable
value, but it allows the constructor to input another Point3d</li>
<li>The coordinates themselves (x, y, z) would be private to the class. This
means they cannot be modified without calling the class methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Actual coding took about 1.5 hours. Another half hour was needed to learn
<a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">jasmine</a>, and another half hour to learn <a href="https://jsdoc.app">JSDoc</a> and write the README.</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>Feedback and pull requests are welcome! If you want to try modifying the code,
fork the <a href="https://github.com/jjhembd/point3d">repository on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>To make sure we don't break anything as we change the code, point3d has a
test suite (implemented in <a href="https://jasmine.github.io/">jasmine</a>, which you can run as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>npm run test
</code></pre>
<p>Please be sure to update the comments in the code. Comments should follow the
<a href="https://jsdoc.app/howto-es2015-classes.html">JSDoc syntax</a>. When you are done,
be sure to rebuild the docs before committing your code. This can be done via
another of the NPM scripts, as follows:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint source lang-bash"><code>npm run build-docs
</code></pre></article>
